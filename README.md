## CS648 Assignment-1

CS648 Assignment 1 is a demo website to learn the basics of _HTML5, GitHub, and Markdown_. This webpage is made to test and learn Git repository hosting server, formatting the readme page inturn to get a rich text using plain text editor, and important basics of _HTML5_.
Here, I have created a readme markdown file to learn and demonstrate various features of markdown.

### A Simple Web Page: Welcome to Flairtales.
Let me explain the structure of web page in further details. The Structure of a simple webpage consists of two major parts:

1. **The Doctype Declaration:**

	A piece of code that tells the browser what kind of information it’s getting, so that it can display your web page properly. It is the first item that appears in the source code of the webpage and it looks like this.  
	> **< !DOCTYPE  html >**
	
2. **The Document Tree:**

	The Document Tree contains a combination of HTML markup organised like a family tree having ancestors, descendants, parent, children & sibling. All the HTML tags are enclosed into < html > tags </ html >. 
There are two parts of the html tag:

	* **Head Tag:** A head tag is a container that has metadata which can be defined as document title, style, script, and other meta information. It is between the html tag and the body tag.
	The head element consists of various tags like meta (Shows the encoding type of the page which is generally “utf-8"), title , script, etc.

	* **Body Tag:** The body tag is used to display the web page's contents, that includes hyperlinks, images, text, lists, tables, etc The body element can also have various other formatting tags like paragraph, anchor, list, header, image, etc.

	The HTML document tree looks like this:
	
		<html lang="en"> 
		<head > 
				<meta charset="UTF-8"> 
				<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> 
				<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge"> 
				<title> Document</title> 
		</head>
		<body>
				<h1> Hello World </h1> 
		</body> 
		</html>
		
All the tags used in a web page has an attribute that dictates certain aspects of the html element. These attributes are made up of a name and a value pair. Each and every attributes are unique and provides additional information to the element. These elements are always specified in the opening tag.

	<!DOCTYPE  html>
	<html  lang="en" >
	<head >
			<meta  charset="UTF-8">
			<meta  name="viewport"  content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
			<meta  http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible"  content="ie=edge">
			<title Document</title>
	</head>
	<body>
			<h1> Hello World </h1>
	</body>
	</html>
